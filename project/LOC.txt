We believe that the JSON files in the "data" folder of the source code should 
contribute, at least partially, to our total LOC count. Certainly, storing data 
in JSON form is not the same kind of work as writing and reasoning about code. 
However, storing information in this manner was a conscious design goal, and 
these files are integral to the game experience. Organizing the information in 
an effective and consistent manner and designing functions that interacted with 
these JSON files also proved to be a challenging task in and of itself.
