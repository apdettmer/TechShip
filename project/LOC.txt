We believe that the json files in the "data" folder for the project
(events.json, events_founded.json, and wordbank.json) should contribute, at
least partially, to our total LOC count. Obviously, putting data in a json file 
is not the same kind of work as writing and reasoning about code, but storing 
information in this manner was a conscious design goal, and these files are 
integral to the game experience. Designing functions that interacted with these
files as we wanted them to also proved to be a challenging task in and of 
itself.
